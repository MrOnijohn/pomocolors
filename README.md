This is a minimalist focus timer inspired by the pomodoro method.
Code is by Claude.ai as an experiment for me to learn, and I take no pride in it, nor responsibility for it.
This repository is only here to share the code to anyone interested, but I will probably not do anything more with this, so consider it abandonware.

"Manual"
Figure out dependencies
Run the script, or make an executable of it using for instance pyinstall.

Start timer with ctrl+alt+s
Pause with ctrl+alt+p
Restart timer with ctrl+alt+r

The timer is turquoise when paused, and when started slowly turns from deep green into vidid yellow for the first fifteen minutes,
then to pure red for the last three minutes when it finally turns to black. The remaining time is also displayed at the bottom of the screen.

I wanted a strip of color to put in between the two windows I work in, just to get a sense of time passing when doing boring work,
and that's why the window is a strange size and shape.
My computer runs Linux Mint 22, and I don't really know what it would take to get it to run on windows or mac.

Hope it brings you some joy and doesn't break anything!
